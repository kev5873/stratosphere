Description:
    Generate a migration to support a stratosphere attachment on your model. The NAME argument represents the model you would like to add an attachment to and the ATTACHMENT_NAME represents the name of the attachment. i.e. rails generate attachment user avatar.

Example:
    rails generate attachment model attachment

    This will create:
        db/migrate/add_attachment_to_model.rb
